At the very first I made the nav bar then I created the tab option which is dynamic. the options on this tab menu are coming from API which I fetched in the index.js file. initially, it will display all the cards then the user can watch out according to catagory. there is another option I added which is a shorting option if someone clicks the short by view button then the card of this catagory will be sorted regarding the views number in assending way. finally,  I added another .html file which is Blog and it's added with a button on the main page. there I have given some questions and their corresponding answers.
